function rawKeys = getRawKeys( dft_data  )
% Function to decode each of the frames to get the number represented by
% the data from the Goertzel Calculation. the argument "magData" is a
% vector with the magnitudes of each of the DTMF Frequencies in the frame
% they were extracted from.

% the output "rawKeys" will be the number represented by each frame. This
% has the numbers decoded from every frame present. frames that represent a
% "silence" will be shows as "_" strings

    %go through each vector and first determine whether it is a silence or
    %an actual DTMF. if it is a silent, add '_' to the output. if it is not
    %a silence, get the indicies of the two highest peaks.

    % after some observation, noticed that the mean of the frames with DTMF
    % frequencies is much higher that the mean of "silent" frames,
    
    % find the 3 largest averages in the frames.
    % not efficient to go through the whole data set there
    % * get top 3 in the first 20 frames
    % * find average of those 3 peaks
    % * the silent frames will be frames with a mean that is less than 10%
    % of the average of the top 3 peaks.
